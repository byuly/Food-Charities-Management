# Food Charities Relational Database
# This project models the operation of food charities to enable food donation and redistribution management. The application operates within the intersection of food logistics, food donor management, food recipient tracking, and food inventory level optimization. By connecting these four pillars to our database, we enable an informative information system to track the operation success of food charities.
