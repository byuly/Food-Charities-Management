# Food Charities Relational Database
This project models the operation of food charities to enable food donation and redistribution management. The application operates within the intersection of food logistics, food donor management, food recipient tracking, and food inventory level optimization. By connecting these four pillars to our database, it enables an informative information system to track the operation success of food charities. It runs on ORACLEDB, a relational database. The overall aim of building this project was getting familiar with various relational database concepts, such as ER diagrams, Normalization, SQL security, and SQL queries!
